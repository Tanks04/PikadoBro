# PikadoBro — Testing Notes

Thanks for testing PikadoBro! 🎯

Please use it as a real darts training app, not only by clicking through screens. Useful bug reports include:

- incorrect scoring or game rules
- Undo behaving unexpectedly
- Speed Game timers freezing, skipping, or counting incorrectly
- Checkout Trainer / Challenge offering or recording the wrong result
- a session disappearing after refresh/restart
- Backup / Restore failing to restore statistics
- controls that are difficult to use on a phone or tablet
- Croatian/English text appearing in the wrong language

For a bug report, please include: **game + what you did + what happened + what you expected**. A screenshot is very helpful.

PikadoBro data is stored locally in the browser/device. Clearing site/browser data can delete training history unless a JSON backup was created first.

## FixTheThing checks

- Custom target 20 + `T1, 20, 5` must result in 1/3 hits.
- Target 20: S20, D20, and T20 must all count as hits.
- Target D20/T20: only the exact requested ring counts.
- Target 20 must offer shortcuts for S20/D20/T20 and neighbouring numbers 5 and 1.
- During the session, there must be no live hit total or percentage.
- Shortcut buttons must enter exactly one dart and the full keypad must still work.
- Finish all 10 rounds and verify that FixTheThing appears in Statistics.
- Automatic must stay locked until enough relevant training data exists; compatible Round the World / Bob's 27 / FixTheThing data may contribute.
